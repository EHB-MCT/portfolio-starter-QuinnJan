# Code Of Conduct

=================

To any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files.
Regardless of your background or experience, we strive to make this an harassment-free environment, to be able to participate in this community the best way possible.

Please communicate in an open and friendly way.

# Positive environment

- Be respectful and kind towards other people.
- Be able to give and receive constructive feedback.
- Take responsibility in your mistakes and learn from the experience.
- Contribute to the community and do what is best for everyone in it.

# Unacceptable behavior

- Personal or political attacks towards someone or a group of people.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing or threatening to publish others' private information.
- Other kinds of behavior that could be interpreted as negative or inappropriate.

# Consequences

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
In case a report is made, 3 scenarios can play out:

1. Warning
   The first time someone would breach the code, a warning wil be send out in private by one of the community leaders. This message warns for any continued behavior and prevents the receiver to have any further contact with the one who reported the incident. Violating these terms may lead to further action.

2. Suspension
   When a warning is ignored or the impact of the violation seriously harms the community, a public suspension will be given by one of the community leaders. The suspension holds a temporary ban on any sort of interaction with the community for a specified amount of time, as well as a ban on any of the provided products the community has to offer.
   Violating these terms may lead to further action.

3. Permanent ban
   When a suspension is breached or a series of violations against the community occur, a permanent ban is given by one of the community leaders. This prevents the receiver of having any contact with the community on a permanent basis.
