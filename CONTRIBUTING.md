# This project

In the README file, there are explanations about this project that could be taken into consideration. Like where this project is likely going to go in the future or a short description on how to ùmake this project for yourself.

For clarity, some guidelines about the future of this project are mentioned here:

- Further expansion on all the CRUD operations for the buyers and cars.
- An added 'sales' model that presents all the sales, with the buyer and sold car.
- A history tab that explains how the sales are going and predicts how sales will go in the near future.
- Some information for the admin, the best sold cars, most loyal customers, ..

To be able to contribute in the best way possible would be to find creative and interactive solutions for the above mentioned features. This would expand the application and make it useful to those who need it.

For those who'd like to contribute in a more general way. Please consider structuring this code like a starting point for those who'd like to develop a similar kind of project.
